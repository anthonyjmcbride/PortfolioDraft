    <p class="bio"> I'm half African American✊🏾 and half white with an Irish background🇮🇪. I was born in Miami, Florida on the Christmas🎄 of 1994 but
  my dad and I moved to Silicon Valley, CA (San Jose to be exact).
   While growing up there, I was exposed to the tech boom and witnessed people become millionaires and billionaires🤑
   over night even though I didn't understand it at the time. I grew up in the East &amp; South side of San Jose which mostly consisted
   of Mexican and Vietnemese Americans. During high school, I started getting into tech when I bought my
   first iPod Touch. I was blown away by the design above anything else. This fueled my desire to pursue design as a career.
   To this day I follow Apple and Jony Ive very closely from their impactful advertising to Ive's design style throughout
   iOS and the product lineups. Steve Jobs along with Kanye West, Will Smith, and Michael Jackson are my idols. Eventually I decided
   to move back to Miami on my own in October 2016 realizing I missed the culture, art🎨, and weather☀️, and . Now my joureny has taken me here,
   writing a bio in HTML as a homework assignment for Wyncode Academy👍🏾. </p>
